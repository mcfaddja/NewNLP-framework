# NewNLP-framework
**Example of generating a new NLP framework in R**
Jonathan McFadden (mcfaddja@uw.edu)

We are going to construct a new NLP framework (*in R*) by using movie reviews label as "positive" or "negative".  We are then going to apply this framework to each chapter of "Huck Finn", as well as "Tom Sawyer".  This README will be updated as the project progresses.
